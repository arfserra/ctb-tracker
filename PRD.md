# Product Requirements Document: Exercise Tracker Web App

## Foundation PRD

### Project Setup
**Objective:**  
Establish the foundational structure and tools for the exercise tracker web app using Streamlit for a simple, web-based interface.  

**Requirements:**  
- Use **Streamlit** for the UI framework to simplify development.  
- Include **Supabase** for cloud storage and authentication.  
- Use **Python** as the primary language for backend and logic.  
- Add **environment variables** for storing Supabase credentials securely.

**Deliverables:**  
1. A Streamlit app initialized with a basic structure.  
2. A Python script (`supabase_client.py`) to initialize and manage the Supabase client with the project's URL and anon key.  
3. A structured folder setup:
   - `/pages/` for Streamlit pages (e.g., Dashboard, AddExercise).
   - `/utils/` for utility/helper functions.
   - `/assets/` for static files if needed.

**Prompt for Copilot:**  
"Set up a Streamlit project for a web-based exercise tracker app. Create a Python file to initialize Supabase client using environment variables. Organize folders as `pages`, `utils`, and `assets` for scalability."

## Feature: Workouts Containing Multiple Exercises with Series

### Objective  
Allow users to log workouts consisting of multiple exercises. Each exercise can have multiple series (sets) with repetitions and associated weights.

### Requirements  
- **Hierarchy:**
  - A workout groups multiple exercises.
  - Each exercise within a workout can contain multiple series.

- **Input Fields:**  
  - **Workout Details:**
    - Name (optional, e.g., "Leg Day").
    - Date (required).
    - Notes (optional).
  - **Exercise Details:**
    - Exercise Name (selected from predefined list).
    - Weight (per exercise, optional).
    - Notes (optional).
  - **Series Details:**
    - Repetitions (integer, required).

- **Backend Integration:**  
  - Store workouts in the `workouts` table.
  - Associate exercises with workouts in the `workout_exercises` table.
  - Track series (sets) for each exercise in the `series` table.

### Deliverables  
1. A Streamlit page (`log_workout.py`) for logging workouts, exercises, and series.
2. A relational database schema:
    - `workouts` table to track each workout session.
    - `workout_exercises` table to associate exercises with workouts.
    - `series` table to track series for each exercise.

**Prompt for Copilot:**  
"Create a Streamlit page for logging workouts. Allow users to:
- Add a workout with a name, date, and notes.
- Add multiple exercises to the workout, each with weight and notes.
- Log series (sets) for each exercise with repetitions and associated weights. Save the data into relational tables: `workouts`, `workout_exercises`, and `series`."

## Feature: Add Exercise

### Objective  
Allow users to create predefined exercises with relevant details, including an optional image, and save them to the cloud.

### Requirements  
- **Input Fields:**  
  - Name (text input, required).  
  - Type (dropdown: Strength, Cardio, Mobility, required).  
  - Description (text area, optional).  
  - Image (file uploader, optional).  

- **Backend Integration:**  
  - Save exercise details to the `exercises` table in Supabase.  
  - Upload image to the Supabase storage bucket `exercise-images`.  
  - Store the image URL in the database.  

- **Validation:**  
  - Ensure all required fields are filled.  
  - Validate image size (<2 MB) and type (JPEG, PNG).

### Deliverables  
1. A Streamlit page (`add_exercise.py`) for adding exercises.  
2. Functionality to upload images to the storage bucket and link their URL to the exercise.  
3. Validation for required fields and image constraints.  

**Prompt for Copilot:**  
"Create a Streamlit page to add exercises. Include text inputs for name and description, a dropdown for type, and a file uploader for images. Use Python to validate inputs and save the data to Supabase's `exercises` table. Upload images to the `exercise-images` bucket and store the URL."

## Feature: View Workouts and Exercises

### Objective  
Enable users to view logged workouts and their associated exercises and series in a hierarchical format.

### Requirements  
- **UI Elements:**  
  - List of workouts with name, date, and notes.  
  - For each workout, show associated exercises with name, weight, and notes.  
  - For each exercise, list its series (sets) with repetitions and weights.  

- **Backend Integration:**  
  - Fetch data from the `workouts`, `workout_exercises`, and `series` tables in Supabase.  

### Deliverables  
1. A Streamlit page (`view_workouts.py`) for fetching and displaying workout data.  
2. Hierarchical display format:
    - Workouts > Exercises > Series.  

**Prompt for Copilot:**  
"Create a Streamlit page to view workouts. Display a list of workouts with associated exercises and their series. Fetch data from the `workouts`, `workout_exercises`, and `series` tables in Supabase."

## Feature: Dashboard

### Objective  
Provide users with an overview of their workout progress, including metrics on exercises and series logged over time.

### Requirements  
- **Summary View:**  
  - Display total workouts, exercises, and series logged.  
  - Show metrics like average repetitions, total weight lifted, and most used exercises.  

- **Visualization:**  
  - Line chart for workout frequency over time.  
  - Bar chart for total weight lifted per exercise.  

- **Backend Integration:**  
  - Fetch data from the `workouts`, `workout_exercises`, and `series` tables.  

### Deliverables  
1. A Streamlit page (`dashboard.py`) displaying workout metrics and visualizations.  
2. Charts implemented using Streamlitâ€™s charting options (e.g., `st.bar_chart`, `st.line_chart`).  

**Prompt for Copilot:**  
"Create a Streamlit dashboard to display workout progress. Include metrics on total workouts, exercises, and series logged. Visualize workout frequency and total weight lifted using charts. Fetch data from the `workouts`, `workout_exercises`, and `series` tables in Supabase."

  - Modify exercises in the workout (weight, notes).
  - Update series (repetitions, weights).  

- **Delete:**  
  - Remove a workout and its associated exercises and series.  
  - Remove an exercise and its series from a workout.  

### Deliverables
